    # Character Builder
    
    Using everything we have covered so far lets build a simple character builder.
    
    We can use the provided `RaceRepository` and `ClassRepository` to source the choices for the races/classes, then we use
    all that data with the `CharacterBuilder` to generate the character.
    
    > The source code for all this can be found within the `Infrastructure` folder within this project, its bare bones simplest
    approach but will at least let us get started.
