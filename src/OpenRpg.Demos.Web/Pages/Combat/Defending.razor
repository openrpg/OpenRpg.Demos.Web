    ## Defending

    We have discussed generating attacks, and that is one of the larger pieces of the puzzle, but we also need to cover
    how we use this attack with a defenders stats to generate a `ProcessedAttack` which details both the damage done
    and the damage defended.

    ### `IAttackProcessor` interface
    This interface defines a single method `ProcessAttack` which requires the attack you wish to apply and the stats of the defender
    (it is assumed they are pre-computed), then will return a `ProcessedAttack` object representing what set of damages the character
    would do.

    If we generate two random characters and then have one attack the other we would do something like:

    ```csharp
    var attackingCharacter = CharacterBuilder.CreateNew().Build();
    var defendingCharacter = CharacterBuilder.CreateNew().Build();
    var randomAttack = AttackGenerator.GenerateAttack(attackingCharacter.Stats);
    var processedAttack = AttackProcessor.ProcessAttack(randomAttack, defendingCharacter.Stats);
    ```

    There is a simple example below that you can use to see what this looks like in practice.

    ### Summary
    Once you have summed the damage done you can do whatever you want with it, directly deduct it from their HP or if you have more complex
    systems you can deduct an amount from HP and an amount from a shield etc, as with most of the system you are free to interpret the data
    however you want.
    
    > You may also notice in some scenarios you will get negative defenses, this happens because they have a weakness to a specific damage type
    so for example if someone has a `-1 Dark Defense` and they are hit with `1 Dark Damage` this 1 damage becomes 2 after defending because we
    need to account for the amplification of weaknesses. So the total damage done here should be `2 Dark Damage`

    ## Applying Damage
    So we now know how to do an attack, and how to apply that attack to a target to work out how much damage the target 
    would receive you also need to be able to apply all the damages to the target in question.
    
    On face value you may be thinking "this is really simple, why cant this all be done in the processor", but its actually
    not that simple. I mean it could be, if you have a simple scenario, but what if you have a game where you have the notion
    of shields which need to be depleted before you remove health, or you have a custom bit of code which means the main
    player only takes 50% damage compared to NPCs etc.
    
    Now with this being said there is a quick "Just apply the damage to the target" helper method in the `OpenRpg.Genres`
    library that lets you do `myEntity.State.ApplyDamageToTarget(theProcessedAttack);` which will simply take all the damages
    contained within the processed attack and just apply it to the `Health` in the `State`.
    
    However if you need something more complicated you can just take the collection of `Damage` objects inside the 
    processed attack and apply them to the health however you see fit.
