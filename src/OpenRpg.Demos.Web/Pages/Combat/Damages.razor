    ## Damages, Attacks & Defenses

    Before we wade into combat its worth quickly covering what damages/defenses are and how they work as well as how they relate to attacks, 
    as the combat system is heavily based upon the concept of damages and attacks.

    ### `Damage` component
    This is quite a simple object and purely contains the type of damage with the value of the damage.

    The concept behind it is that an overall attack can be broken down into various types of damage which may be from different
    sources. For example lets say you have a flaming sword, rather than just do a blanket 10 damage you may do 8 slashing damage
    and 2 fire damage.

    > As with most examples we are drawing off the pre-made example damage types which can be found within the [OpenRpg.Fantasy](https://github.com/openrpg/OpenRpg.Fantasy/blob/master/src/OpenRpg.Genres.Fantasy/Types/DamageTypes.cs) repo.

    You are free to have as few or many damage types as you want, as ultimately its just an `int` describing the type of the damage
    then the amount of associated damage that goes with that.
    
    The damage is just the start of the combat journey though as damage itself is just seen as the raw damage you have output,
    it needs to be processed further down the line against a potential target to see how much of that damage is actually applied.

    ### `Attack` component
    The Attack object contains all the applicable damage types and their amounts via the `Damage` object.

    The idea is that you generate an `Attack` for a character which can then be applied to 1-N sources, so this way you may
    have your flaming sword dealing 8 slashing and 2 fire damage as an AoE to 3 targets who are in range, however each of 
    those 3 targets may have different defense so after its all been processed you may do far less damage to each of the 
    targets.
    
    > We will cover attacks more in the next section as we need to discuss `IAttackGenerator` and `IAttackProcessor` which
    will give us some insight into how you can create your own damage handling mechanics.

    ### `Defenses`
    So now we have the notion of `Damage` and `Attack` object and we can see how we generate an attack from someone, however
    we also need the notion of `Defenses` which act as the mitigation amount of a specific damage.
    
    Given the previous example you may have an attack with 8 slashing and 2 fire damage, but you may have 5 fire defense 
    and 3 slashing defense meaning once the mitigation has been applied you would only take 5 slashing damage and 0 fire damage.
