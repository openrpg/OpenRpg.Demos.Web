    ## Requirements In General
    We have skipped diving into requirements as to really verify requirements are met we need access to two things (by default).
    - Characters data
    - Game State data

    So for example lets say you have a sword that the player can only use once he has beaten a boss or got to a certain level.
    You would need to be able to verify these requirements against the characters data as well as the game state data. As
    in some cases you may have multiple characters in party based games, so while you would only have 1 game state tied to the
    player, each character can have different class/race/level/stat data etc.

    So for now lets ignore game state data, as we will cover that in quests and instead look at requirements that the character
    may or may not meet.

        ## Random Character vs Item Requirements
        So in this scenario here we will let you randomly generate a character (As we have already covered how to make and manage characters),
        and have 2 items to see how the item requirements are met/failed based upon the characters data.

    ## The Requirements Checking
    So we have 2 bits of code running here, one is:

    ```csharp
    var areRequirementsMet = RequirementsChecker.AreRequirementsMet(Character, Item.ItemTemplate);
    ```

    This is an extension method that checks the item templates requirements against the character and if not met you get the red 
    border and background, then at the requirement level there is:

    ```csharp
    var isRequirementMet = RequirementsChecker.IsRequirementMet(Character, requirement);
    ```
    
    This checks an individial requirement and colours it red or green on the item requirement listing.
    
    As almost anything can have requirements applied, be it races, classes, items, quests, modifications, effects etc you can really
    customize how the player can make use of and unlock certain items via progression/stats etc. We didn't cover one of the other parts
    of requirements checking which is quest related, but we will do that later when we learn more about quests.
